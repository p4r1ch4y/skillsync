### Core Algorithms

SkillSync uses sophisticated matching algorithms:

1. **Match Score Computation**
```typescript
function computeMatchScore(
  userSkills: UserSkill[],
  requiredSkills: number[]
): number
```
- Calculates match percentage between user skills and job requirements
- Weights verified skills higher than claimed skills

2. **Skill Similarity**
```typescript
function computeSkillSimilarity(
  skillVector1: number[],
  skillVector2: number[]
): number
```
- Uses cosine similarity for advanced skill matching
- Enables nuanced comparison of skill sets
